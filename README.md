# Adverse-Event-Data-Analysis
Two datasets (A and B) were used for adverse event (AE) analysis.

Cohort A: AE.dataA.csv for AE data and clin.dataA.csv for the corresponding clinical outcomes.

Cohort B: AE.dataB.csv for AE data and clin.dataB.csv for the corresponding clinical outcomes.

Details of AE data analysis were published in Cancers (Chen et.al., 2023): Early Adverse Event Derived Biomarkers in Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Immunotherapy.
